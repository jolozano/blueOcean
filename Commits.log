11 Aug 2021:
    - Changed CSS class ".cohort-bar-form" 'bottom' from 80px to 120px because it was on top of buttons
    - Used ternary operator for the "Add/Remove" cohort buttons
        - Used the .state.changing_cohort property to dictate action/text of buttons
        - Added to the callback of the "Add" button
    - Re-created .json seed documents; reflects limited cohort range.
