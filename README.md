The application gives adminstrators visibility on student transitions from miltary to civilian life. The Transition Tracker gives students a road map to transition succesfully out of the military.***

## Project Workflow and Requirements

#### **The team collaborated on project ideas and discussed efficient workflow methods.**
  * Utilized a collaborative platform for idea/work managment
    * Platform must allowed all team members to contribute/view ideas
    * Platform should allowd users to add details to workflow
  * Operated within GitHub
    * Initilized a repository
    * Each team member had access to the repo
    * Each team member utilized seperate branches

#### **Each team member worked within their respective branch.**
  * Components and Services
    * Had it's own directory
    * Commited in team members branch frequently.
    * Components functioned correctly by themselves.
      * Components were not a full-fledge app
    * Service allowed other services to access it's component

---------------------------------------------------

## Knowledge Gaps Bridged

  * Researched and established MongoDB to track all data pertaining to the application

  * Researched and implemented Single Sign On Google Authentication to restrict access and secure data


---------------------------------------------------

## Unexpected Challenges

  * Local environment inconsistencies delayed the implementation of database installation for multiple develoopers

---------------------------------------------------

## Demo

---------------------------------------------------

## Install

  * Create authorization credentials
  * Update .env file with your Client ID provided to you when creating your application credentials. Go to [Google Log-In Docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) for a set up guide.
